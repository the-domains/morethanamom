description: "There are so many things that can break your spirit in this life. Break you until you just don't believe in goodness's sake any longer - instead you begin to think that everyone is out to make a mark on your life at your expense. Once you begin to operate in this manner, its almost impossible to change your frame of mind. Extra-ordinary circumstances become necessary to break down the wall you will inadvertently build around yourself - and the ability to love seems lost."

There are so many things that can break your spirit in this life. Break you until you just don't believe in goodness's sake any longer - instead you begin to think that everyone is out to make a mark on your life at your expense. Once you begin to operate in this manner, its almost impossible to change your frame of mind. Extra-ordinary circumstances become necessary to break down the wall you will inadvertently build around yourself - and the ability to love seems lost.

While I understand the ups and downs of life, and the unequivocal love one can have for their child, I struggle with how a broken spirit loves another (not their child) ever again. I see relationships, people with faith, hope for the future, and love. I feel these things only with my children. I see their smile, their happiness, it produces such wonderful feelings for me.  I do not have these same joyful feelings when it comes to anyone outside of them. 

I take responsibility for my loneliness, for the fact that I feel isolated and unrelateable  - but I am lost on where to begin on having faith in people again.  Everyone is out for themselves, it seems the only chance at honesty comes with total trust, comfort, and support - which all must be given endlessly or you are labeled instantly as "not loving". ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c54fafea-6218-4447-9ad8-b93dd63f9521.jpg)
